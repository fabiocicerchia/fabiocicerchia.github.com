Abstract

   This document illustrates the media type SES (service expression
   sythax) used for data-exchange for REST architectures' consumers.

1.  Introduction

   SES is an Atom-based XML-dialect that describes lists of related
   information known as "entities".  Entities are composed of a number of
   items, known as "entity", each with an extensible set of attached
   metadata.  For example, each entity has an ID and a category.

   The primary use case that SES addresses is to help in serving raw data 
   from an HTTP interface, no matter about the data-source (ie, a database).

1.1.  Examples

   A brief SES Document:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
  <service>
    <title>Webservice</title>
    <link href="http://example.org/api.php"/>

      <link rel="self" href="http://example.org/api.php" type="application/vnd.fc.ses.+xml;v=1.0" title="Entry point" />
    </entrypoint>
    <entrypoint>
      <link rel="service" href="http://example.org/api.php/Users" type="application/vnd.fc.ses.+xml;v=1.0" title="Users" />
    </entrypoint>
  </service>
   
2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  XML-Related Conventions

2.1.1.  XML tags

   There is no limitation in providing metadata with SES, while the
   built-in tags of SES are:

     * the ones expressed via XML's namespaces mechanism
     * all those ones provided by the Atom Syndication Format
     * a series of generally understood media-type level tags

2.1.1.  Media type level tags

2.1.1.1.   Service

    The service tag allows you to identify the entry point of the exposed
    HTTP interface.

    Clients should start from this resource in order to consume each feature
    offered by the architecture.

    Service tag must contain one or more entrypoint tags, which identify
    services exposed by the interface.

2.1.1.2.   Entities

    Used to describe a collection of entities.

2.1.1.3.   Entity

    Used to identify a single entity: inside an entity tag there is no
    limitation in which tags can be used, as they usually represent the 
    entity's attributes.
